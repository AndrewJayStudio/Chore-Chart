# Chore-Chart
A chore chart manager
It was created with my mom in mind. She regularly drew out chore charts for my siblings, so I thought I could help out my mom and other parents by developing an application that compiled a weekly chore chart that was both dynamic and persistent. The chores will change week to week based on pre-inputted information and has a big "print" button so they can be hung on the fridge. Features include compatibility for multiple children, a color picker to change the chart's theme, and a 2000s style interface (Though an updated UI is planned for version 2.0). Chore Chart runs on Electron.
